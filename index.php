Creating Arrays
The basic syntax for declaring an array is as follows: $arrayName = array(value1, value2, â€¦);. An index number is designated to each array element in order from 0 to the last element. To retrieve data from an array, we use these index numbers like so: $arrayName[indexNumber]. */

Creating Associative Arrays
Associative arrays allow us to manage a collection of data like normal arrays. The difference is that instead of using index numbers to manage individual elements, you can specify values as keys.

Creating Functions
A function is a section of code designed to accomplish a specific task and return an output. Some common and useful functions are already embedded in PHP; those are called built-in functions. For example strlen returns the number of characters in a string. Here, the value in parentheses () is called an argument.*/
 
    /*Using Functions
Let's look at some other built-in functions: count returns the number of elements in an array; rand returns a random integer between the first argument and the second argument. There are many other PHP built-in functions, but you don't have to memorize them. It's better to look up and learn about useful functions for specific purposes..*/

Creating Functions (2)
You can also create functions yourself. When you group code in one place, you can make changes to all the places it's used at once by editing the function containing it.

Arguments
When calling a function, you can pass a value to be used within the function. Values that are passed to a function are known as arguments. To use arguments in a function, you need to specify a corresponding parameter to receive the argument in the function definition. If there are multiple parameters, you need to separate each with a comma ,. */
